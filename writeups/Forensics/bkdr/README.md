## Description
```
I got this open source end-to-end encrypted messenger app from one of 
my cryptobros on the darkweb. He told me it is ultranextgen, zero trust and decentralized 
based on Web 3.0. However, get a feeling that someone is watching me when I use 
it.


What are they doing to my phone?

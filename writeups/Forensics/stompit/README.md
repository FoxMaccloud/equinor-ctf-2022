## Description
```
**Techarisma Chapter 4/7**

Timestomping is a common anti-forensic technique that attackers and 
malware authors use to hide their tracks. When a file was actually created or 
modified are things they would rather you don't know. Our incident responders 
suspect an attacker has tampered with one of the employees' payment data. The 
responders have extracted the `$MFT` along with the files from the relevant directory. 

Can you find the file?

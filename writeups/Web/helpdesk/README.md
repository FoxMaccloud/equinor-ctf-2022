## Description
```
So we are tired of the Helpdesk system so we decided to creat a new one. We are realasing version 0.1a now.

Looks like some of the developers done a great job, I can't see any problems in the code and all works fine. To motivate you there is an
Administator note with a message you may need? Can you find it?? There is no need for any kind of brute force as the Administrator password is
over 45 char long so plase do not do this.

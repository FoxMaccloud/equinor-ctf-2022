# Notes - Revisited
Author: vcpo

Flag: `EPT{30.05.2001_06:45}`
## Description
```
Category: Forensics

The hacker claims we have planted this note on his phone. Can you find out the actual date and time when it was last modified?

The flag format is: `EPT{31.12.2099_23:59}`

P.S: This is not an artificial challenge - this timestamp is indeed added by the notes application and can be recreated easily on your phone.

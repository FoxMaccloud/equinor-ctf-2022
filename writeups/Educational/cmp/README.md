Can you figure out how the program validates the password?

Tools like [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) or [IDA Freeware](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/) are great for static analysis. For dynamic analysis [gdb](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) with a plugin like [pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) or [gef](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) is recommended.

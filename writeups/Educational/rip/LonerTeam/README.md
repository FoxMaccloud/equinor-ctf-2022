# rip

The source code `rip.c` uses the function *gets()* to get user-input, which is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack.

We find the offset for overwriting the RIP-register to be 120 using [find_offset.py](find_offset.py).

We find the address of the assembly *ret*-instruction using ROPgadget (this step can possibly be omitted, but will work with it included as well)
```bash
$Â ROPgadget --binary rip --only ret

0x000000000040101a : ret

```

We need the address of the *win()* function so that we can overwrite the RIP-register with it
```python
 elf.symbols["win"]
```
Sending the crafted payload with `offset + ret + win`overwrites the RIP-register with the address of *win()*, giving us the shell

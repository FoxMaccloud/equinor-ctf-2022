# A solution for Super Secure Storage

We find 2 storage accounts and only one of the accounts has something in it, but we are not allowed to read/write the file.

But if we go into the storage account settings and change the settings, we find that we are allowed to change the storage account from private to public.

This allows us to access the file in the storage account.

Hurray! We found the flag ðŸš©

## Description
```
Say hello to our shiny new web app protected by secure HTTP: [flag2webapp](https://flag2webapp.azurewebsites.net). The flag can be found as a secret in a key vault. 

Ensure your team have created the team-spesific Azure resources in the [OnDemand portal](https://ctf.equinor.com/ondemand/). Use the credentials you got to solve this challenge.
